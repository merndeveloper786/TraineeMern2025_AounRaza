# Git, GitHub, and Git Cheat Sheet Report

## Introduction

In the world of software development, **version control** is crucial for collaboration and code management. During my learning journey, I explored the concepts of **Git**, **GitHub**, a course on both, and compiled a useful **cheat sheet**. This report summarizes my understanding and key takeaways.

## What is Git?

**Git** is a distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes in their codebase and collaborate with others. It was created by **Linus Torvalds** in 2005.

### Key Features:

- Tracks changes to files and folders
- Enables branching and merging
- Allows working offline
- Supports collaboration with multiple developers

## What is GitHub?

**GitHub** is a cloud-based platform built around Git. It provides a user-friendly interface and powerful tools for hosting and managing Git repositories.

### Main Uses:

- Hosting repositories
- Collaboration through pull requests and issues
- Continuous Integration/Deployment (CI/CD)
- Open-source contributions
- Documentation via README.md and Wikis

## Git and GitHub Course Summary

I completed a course that covered both **Git and GitHub**, including practical use cases and commands. Below is a summary of what I learned:

### Git Topics:

- Initializing a repo (`git init`)
- Tracking files (`git add`)
- Committing changes (`git commit`)
- Viewing history (`git log`)
- Branching and merging (`git branch`, `git merge`)
- Stashing changes (`git stash`)

### GitHub Topics:

- Creating remote repositories
- Cloning (`git clone`)
- Pushing and pulling changes (`git push`, `git pull`)
- Forking and contributing to others' repos
- Using pull requests for code reviews

## Git Cheat Sheet

Here is a quick reference to some of the most commonly used Git commands:

| Command                    | Description                               |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `git init`                 | Initialize a new Git repository           |
| `git clone <url>`          | Clone a remote repository                 |
| `git status`               | Check the status of your working tree     |
| `git add <file>`           | Stage a file for commit                   |
| `git commit -m "message"`  | Commit changes with a message             |
| `git log`                  | Show commit history                       |
| `git branch`               | List branches                             |
| `git checkout <branch>`    | Switch to a branch                        |
| `git merge <branch>`       | Merge another branch into the current one |
| `git push origin <branch>` | Push changes to remote repo               |
| `git pull origin <branch>` | Pull changes from remote repo             |
| `git stash`                | Temporarily save uncommitted changes      |
