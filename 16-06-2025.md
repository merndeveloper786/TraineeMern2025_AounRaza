### 🌐 HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)

HTTP is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web. It defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, and how web servers and browsers should respond to various requests.

**Common Methods:**

- `GET`: Retrieve data
- `POST`: Send data
- `PUT`: Update data
- `DELETE`: Remove data

### 🕸️ How the Internet Works

The Internet is a global network connecting millions of computers and devices. Data travels across the Internet in small packets via routers and switches.

**Key Concepts:**

- Data is transmitted in packets
- Routers and switches guide the data
- Protocols like **TCP/IP** ensure reliability
- Web browsers interact with servers using **URLs** and **HTTP/HTTPS** protocols

---

### 🌍 DNS (Domain Name System)

DNS translates human-friendly domain names into IP addresses that computers use to identify each other.

**How it works:**

- A DNS query is sent when a domain is entered in a browser
- It resolves the domain to the IP address of the server
- DNS servers are distributed globally for efficiency and reliability

### 🔌 API (Application Programming Interface)

APIs are sets of rules that allow different software applications to communicate with each other.

**In Web Development:**

- Often use **HTTP** to enable interaction between clients and servers
- Common uses include fetching and sending data, integrating services, and more

### 🧱 HTML Terminology

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) structures content on the web.

**Key Terms:**

- **Elements**: The building blocks of HTML
- **Tags**: Markup used to define elements (e.g., `<p>`, `<div>`)
- **Attributes**: Provide additional information about elements (e.g., `class`, `id`)

## 📝 Key Takeaways

- Understanding **HTTP** and **APIs** is crucial for web development and communication between services.
- Knowing how the **Internet** and **DNS** work helps in troubleshooting connectivity and domain issues.
- Familiarity with **HTML terminology** is essential for structuring and designing web pages.
