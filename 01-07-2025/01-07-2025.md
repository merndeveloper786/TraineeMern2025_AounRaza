## 📚 Topics Covered

### 🔗 Promises

Promises are a way to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript.

**Key Concepts:**

- A Promise represents a value that may be available now, later, or never.
- States: `pending`, `fulfilled`, `rejected`
- Methods: `.then()`, `.catch()`, `.finally()`

**Example:**

```js
let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // async operation
});
promise
  .then((result) => console.log(result))
  .catch((error) => console.error(error));
```

### ⏳ Async/Await

`async` and `await` are syntactic sugar over Promises to make asynchronous code look synchronous.

**Usage:**

- `async` makes a function return a Promise.
- `await` pauses execution until the Promise is resolved.

**Example:**

```js
async function fetchData() {
  let data = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data");
  let result = await data.json();
  console.log(result);
}
```

### 🔒 Closures

Closures are functions that remember the scope in which they were created.

**Use Cases:**

- Data privacy
- Function factories
- Event handlers

**Example:**

```js
function outer() {
  let count = 0;
  return function inner() {
    count++;
    return count;
  };
}
const counter = outer();
```

### 🚀 Hoisting

Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top of the current scope.

**Key Points:**

- Function declarations are hoisted fully.
- `var` declarations are hoisted but not initialized.
- `let` and `const` are hoisted but stay in a "temporal dead zone".

**Example:**

```js
console.log(a); // undefined
var a = 10;
```

### 🎉 Events

Events are actions that occur in the browser that can be handled with JavaScript.

**Types of Events:**

- Mouse: `click`, `mouseover`, `mouseout`
- Keyboard: `keydown`, `keyup`
- Form: `submit`, `change`

**Example:**

```js
document.getElementById("btn").addEventListener("click", () => {
  alert("Button clicked!");
});
```

## 📝 Key Takeaways

- Promises and async/await simplify working with asynchronous code.
- Closures allow functions to access variables from their lexical scope.
- Understanding hoisting helps avoid bugs due to undefined behavior.
- Events are essential for building interactive web applications.
