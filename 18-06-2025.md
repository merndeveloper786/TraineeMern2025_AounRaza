# Advanced CSS Topics: Flexbox, Grid, and More

## 1. Flexbox

**Flexbox** (Flexible Box Layout) is a CSS3 layout mode designed for distributing space along a single column or row. It helps to create responsive layouts easily.

### Example

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  height: 200px;
}
.item {
  background: #4caf50;
  color: white;
  padding: 10px;
  margin: 5px;
}
```

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="item">Item 1</div>
  <div class="item">Item 2</div>
</div>
```

**Output:**  
The items will be centered both vertically and horizontally within the container.

## 2. CSS Grid

**CSS Grid** provides a two-dimensional grid-based layout system, enabling complex layouts to be built easily.

### Example

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr 1fr;
  gap: 10px;
}
.grid-item {
  background: #2196f3;
  color: white;
  padding: 20px;
  text-align: center;
}
```

```html
<div class="grid-container">
  <div class="grid-item">1</div>
  <div class="grid-item">2</div>
  <div class="grid-item">3</div>
</div>
```

**Output:**  
Three columns with different widths and spacing between them.

## 3. Additional Advanced CSS Topics

### a. CSS Variables (Custom Properties)

CSS variables allow you to reuse values throughout your stylesheet.

```css
:root {
  --main-color: #ff6347;
}
.button {
  background: var(--main-color);
  color: white;
}
```

### b. Responsive Design (Media Queries)

Media queries make your layouts adapt to different screen sizes.

```css
@media (max-width: 600px) {
  .container {
    flex-direction: column;
  }
}
```

### c. CSS Transitions and Animations

Transitions and animations bring interactivity and motion to UI elements.

```css
.box {
  transition: background 0.5s;
}
.box:hover {
  background: #f44336;
}
```

### d. Pseudo-classes and Pseudo-elements

These help in targeting elements in specific states or parts of elements.

```css
a:hover {
  color: orange;
}
p::first-letter {
  font-size: 2em;
}
```
