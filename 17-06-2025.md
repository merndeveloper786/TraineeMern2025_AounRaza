# Report: Advanced HTML and Introduction to CSS

## Advanced HTML and Semantic Tags

Today, I deepened my understanding of HTML by exploring advanced concepts and the use of semantic tags. Semantic tags such as `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>` were introduced. These tags help to structure web pages in a meaningful way, making the content more accessible and improving SEO. Using semantic tags also enhances the readability of the code and assists browsers and assistive technologies in understanding the layout and hierarchy of the content.

Key takeaways:

- Semantic HTML provides better structure and meaning to web documents.
- It improves accessibility for users relying on assistive technologies.
- Search engines use semantic tags to better interpret web content.

## Introduction to CSS

Alongside advanced HTML, I started learning the basics of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). CSS is used to style and layout web pages. I learned about various selectors, properties, and how to apply styles to HTML elements. CSS allows for the separation of content (HTML) from presentation (CSS), making web development more efficient and flexible.

Key topics covered:

- CSS syntax and how to link CSS to an HTML file.
- Basic selectors (element, class, and ID selectors).
- Common properties such as color, background, font, margin, and padding.
- Inline, internal, and external CSS.

## Conclusion

Learning advanced HTML with semantic tags and the basics of CSS has provided a strong foundation for building modern, well-structured, and visually appealing web pages. I now understand how to create more accessible and maintainable web content.
